# RightAnswerSaver
Chrome extension and C# Api. Saves the correct answers, sends them to the Api, it saves them in Json format, and subsequently whoever will pass the tests, the previously saved correct answer under the green background glows. It was made for Optima, but by rewriting the extension could save any answers from any site. I used C# .Net 5 and JavaScript with jQuery to write it.
